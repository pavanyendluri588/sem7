This command is used to test an HDFS file’s existence of zero length of the file or whether if it is a directory or not.

options:

–d	used to check whether if it is a directory or not, returns 0 if it is a directory
–e 	used to check whether they exist or not, returns 0 if the exists
–f 	used to check whether there is a file or not, returns 0 if the file exists
–s	used to check whether the file size is greater than 0 bytes or not, returns 0 if the size is greater than 0 bytes
–z	used to check whether the file size is zero bytes or not. If the file size is zero bytes, then returns 0 or else returns 1.
Example:

hadoop fs -test -[defsz] /user/test/test.txt

echo $? --- to get the result of test command    (linux)






hadoop fs -getmerge -nl /user/Dell/f1.txt /user/Dell/f2.txt ~/Dektop/mergefile.txt    (linux)


hadoop fs -checksum /user/Dell/f1.txt



hadoop fsck - /   ( to check status of file system if healty or not)


to check how many files in one directory and size occupied:

hadoop fs -ls /user/Dell/		(this is location)

hadoop fs -count /user/Dell/		( this will give count of file dir and size)


hadoop fs -rm /user/Dell/a1.txt   			( deletes a file)


How to change groupname of file
hdfs dfs -ls /user/Dell				--- to check the groupname of file 


hadoop fs -chgrp sandeep /user/Dell/a2.txt    		--- will update group to given name


STAT COMMAND: (linux)

hadoop fs -stat %b /user/Dell/a2.txt		for size in bits
hadoop fs -stat %g /user/Dell/a2.txt		for group of the file
hadoop fs -stat %r /user/Dell/a2.txt		for replication factor of file
hadoop fs -stat %u /user/Dell/a2.txt		will give user of file
hadoop fs -stat %y /user/Dell/a2.txt		will give last modified timestamp for file



Usage command:  

helps for syntax

hadoop fs -usage mkdir				to know syntax of mkdir


help command:

to give syntax and all information

hadoop fs -help cat	



hadoop fs -head /user/Dell/hadoop.txt		( first kb of file)
hadoop fs -tail /user/Dell/hadoop.txt		(last 1kb of file)


hadoop fs -expunge		( to clean trash files)


hadoop fs -ls /user/Dell/hadoop.txt			check owner & group of file (Dell & supergroup)


hadoop fs -chown sandeep:sandeep /user/Dell/hadoop.txt    to change owner & group of file

change permission:  ( user group other i.e. ugo 10 character) 
hadoop fs -chmod 777 /user/Dell/hadoop.txt


Change or setting up replication factor:

hadoop fs -setrep -w 3 /user/Dell/hadoop.txt			( w means wait till replication complete)


hadoop fs -truncate -w 100 /user/Dell/hadoop.txt ( 100 size will be left)  ( to reduce the size of log file i.e replicated data in log file will be deleted so unwanted data will be deleted)


SET ATTRIBUTE SOME EXTRA:
user trusted system security
hadoop fs -setfattr -n 'user.sk' -v thisisdummyfile /user/Dell/hadoop.txt

GET ATTRIBUTE
hadoop fs -getfattr -d /user/Dell/hadoop.txt		d-scanning
